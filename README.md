# Parking_Lot

This is an automated ticketing system that allows customers to use our parking lot without human intervention. 
When a car enters the parking lot, we want to have a ticket issued to the driver. The ticket issuing process includes:- 

	1: Taking note of the number written on the vehicle registration plate and the age of the driver of the car.
	2: Allocating an available parking slot to the car before actually handing over a ticket to the driver.
	
The customer is always allocated a slot nearest to the entry. 

The system should provide us with the ability to find out:-

	1: Vehicle Registration numbers for all cars which are parked by the driver of a certain age,
	2: Slot number in which a car with a given vehicle registration plate is parked. 
	3: Slot numbers of all slots where cars of drivers of a particular age are parked.


The input commands are read from the input.txt file and output is printed to the stdout.
